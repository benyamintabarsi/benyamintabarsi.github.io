I am a PhD student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I joined the [Game2Learn Lab](https://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu) supervised by Dr. Tiffany Barnes in Spring 2022. 

My research lies in the intersection of CS education, data mining, and educational technology. The focus of my current research is on enhancing the learning experience of novice programmers by analyzing their coding patterns and creating intelligent support features. 

More specifically, I am trying to find coding behaviors that are associated with moments when novices struggle.  We will use this information to create some detectors that identify those moments and provide students with quality intervention. Besides that, I am actively collaborating with other researchers on studies investigating tools that help students and teachers to have a better programming experience.
