I am a PhD student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I joined the [Game2Learn Lab](https://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu) supervised by Dr. Tiffany Barnes in Spring 2022. 

My research lies in the intersection of CS education, data mining, and developing educational technologies. I am trying to enhance the learning experience of novice programmers by analyzing their coding patterns and creating intelligent support features. I am also collaborating on a project to improve a system designed for submitting and grading students' programming assignments.
